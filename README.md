# How its work? 

the tool working with 2 APIs

1. WhoisXMLAPI.com for gathering domain registry information.
2. Livedns.co.il API for purchase a domain
3. Schedule a Purchase on the expiry date and adds more 90 days (The time of grace of the Israeli domain registrar)


For now this tool available only with LiveDNS API so its mean its suitable now only to israeli users cause live dns has only hebrew lanaguge but its working almost all kinds of tld.
